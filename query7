In String compare, each and every letter is compared with the other.

var a='world'
var b='hello'
var c='two'
a>b - true
sinc w is greater than h
b>c - false
since h is not greater than t

x='hear'
y='heer'
x<y - true
here, first letter (h) is equal in both
second letter (e) is equal in both
third letter (a) is less than (e)
so x is less than y

d='HELLO'
e='hello'
d<e - true
could see that lower case letter has bigger than upper case.
